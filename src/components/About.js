      This is the Flatiron school final project for Stef Claus, a full stack web developer living in Washington, DC.
      <br></br><br></br>
      This project uses a Rails backend and a React-Redux frontend. It was inspired by my desire to read all of the top 10 2020  New York Times Books of the year, and record what I thought of them. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      For an additional questions, please feel free to contact Stef at stef.claus@gmail.com.
